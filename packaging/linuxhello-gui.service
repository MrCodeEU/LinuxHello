# NOTE: The GUI is now part of the main linuxhello binary (Wails desktop app)
# that requires a display server (X11/Wayland). It cannot run as a headless
# systemd service.
#
# To launch the GUI, run: sudo linuxhello
# Or use the desktop launcher: LinuxHello (in your applications menu)

# This service file is kept for reference only and should not be enabled.
